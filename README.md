### An executive summary:
What is your goal?
Where did you get your data?
What are your metrics?
What were your findings?
What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings?
### Summarize your statistical analysis, including:
implementation
evaluation
inference
Clearly document and label each section of your notebook(s)
Logically organize your information in a persuasive, informative manner.
Include notebook headers and subheaders, as well as clearly formatted markdown for all written components.
Include graphs/plots/visualizations with clear labels.
Comment and explain the purpose of each major section/subsection of your code.
Document your code for your future self, as if another person needed to replicate your approach.
Clearly document all of your decision points in the relevant sections
How did you acquire your data?
How did you transform or engineer your data? Why?
How did you select your model?
How did you optimize hyperparameters?
Host your notebook and any other materials in your own public Github Repository.
### You repo should have README file that guides us through the repository and links to important files.
Include links and explanations to any outside libraries or source code used.
Host a copy of your dataset or include a link to a remotely hosted version.

## You will present your project and findings in a 15 minute presentation on TBD! You should expect the members of your audience to be non-technical in nature. Your presentation should provide a summary of your problem, your approach to modeling that problem, and your ultimate findings.

## Things to Keep in Mind

Make sure your presentation fits within the allotted time! Check with your local instructor for exactly how much time you have.
Your presentation should focus on summarizing your problem statement, your approach, your findings, and how it might be used in the future.
You will not be able to present every facet of your work, so please do not try to do that! Instead, try and identify the most salient points of your project and show those off instead.
Particularly when presenting to a non-technical audience, remember that what and why can be much more interesting than how:
What are you trying to predict?
Why are you doing it? Who cares?
What are some predictions your model has made? Where they any good?
What will you use it for in the future? Are there limitations or risks?
Do not use technical terms unless you can clearly and succinctly define them.
Note, you will not need to go into how you picked your model or how you chose your hyperparameters (in fact, usually better to keep hyperparameters just to us data scientists!)
Try to craft a story/narrative around your project. Don't just dump facts on your audience.
Have fun! This is a celebration of the 12 weeks of hard work that you have done!
